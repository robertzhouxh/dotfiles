;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Basic edit toolkit.
;;
;; This is my basic edit toolkit that separate from `lazycat-toolkit'.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put basic-toolkit.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'basic-toolkit)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/08/26
;;      * Add function `goto-line-with-feedback', use `display-line-numbers-mode' instead `linum-mode', for better performance.
;;      * `match-paren' should instead by `paredit-match-paren' by `paredit-extension.el'.
;;
;; 2018/07/13
;;      * Add `css-sort-buffer' for sort css attributable before format css buffer.
;;
;; 2018/06/14
;;      * Add function `kill-unused-buffers'
;;
;; 2009/02/07
;;      * First released.
